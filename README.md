# KNN
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a straightforward classification algorithm:KNN stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions). It predicts the class of a new data point by a majority vote of its k nearest neighbors. The choice of k influences the model's accuracy: a smaller 
k means more complex decision boundaries, while a larger k smoothens the decision boundaries. KNN is sensitive to the choice of distance metric used (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan).
